# HTML-Forms-Tables
In this exercise tables and forms, Semantic HTML, and HTML5 media were introduced. 

## Semantic HTMLL

Using these new elements to structure your HTML in such a way that the element name is descriptive of the content inside of it. HTML5 allows us to be a little more precise in pairing our content with our elements. Semantic HTML tags don't alter your page in any specific way, but make more sense to the developer and reader of the HTML as to what they do. Here are some semantic HTML5 tags
- header - used to display the header information on a page
- nav - used to display a navbar for navigating a page
- section - used to display a section of the page
- article - used to display independent, self-contained content.
- aside - used to display content aside from main content (on the side)
- footer - used to display the footer information on a page

## Tables
They are great for displaying certain kinds of data
- table - This tag encompasses the entire table and wraps all of your HTML code for a table 
- tr - The table row element defines a row of cells which can include td and/or th tags
- th - The table header tag defines a cell as the "header" for group of cells. This is traditionally placed inside of a thead tag.
- td - The table data tag defines a cell of a table that contains some data.
- thead - The table head tag defines a set of rows which define the columns of a table 
- tbody - defines one or more tr element data-rows to be the body of its parent table element (as long as no tr elements are immediate children of that table element
- tfoot - The table foot tag defines a set of rows summarizing the columns of the table

## Forms
We use forms to transmit data to other pages and servers. HTML Forms are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a web site or application. They allow users to send data to the web site. Most of the time that data is sent to the web server, but the web page can also intercept it to use it on its own. An HTML Form is made of one or more widgets. Those widgets can be text fields (single line or multi line), select boxes, buttons, check boxes, or radio buttons. Most of the time, those widgets are paired with a label that describes their purpose.
- To get started with a form, we need a form></form tag and an action attribute
- following label and input tag

## HTML5 MEDIA
With HTML5 comes the ability to embed audio and video into our HTML. We can do this using the audio tag and video tag.

### iframe
The iframe tag is used to embed another document (HTML page) within the current page whether its a video or audio
- iframe tag
